# SimpleOrm
Immature. Do not use.

This is just a no-frills simple ORM class for PHP/sqlite. Project goals are to

  - be as simple and small as possible
  - be clean.

It is **not** a goal to be compatible with other DBMS than sqlite (at the moment) or to implement feature X that
other ORM Y already has.

GPL v3 or commercial licence :) from github@reneschmidt.de. Do not use this in your closed source project
without paying me. I don't like that.
